Among the game\u0027s mechanics, it was the first time we saw a continuous world that could be freely explored, power-ups that permanently enhanced the main character\u0027s abilities and a battery save feature that allowed players to keep their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced action sequences with discovery, secrets and exploration."

After completing one of the two games, both can be linked to form a single linear plot with an alternate ending. Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons were often credited as being two of the top games for the Game Boy Color."
